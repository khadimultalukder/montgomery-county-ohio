REM Step 2: Move to the project folder so relative paths (config\, logs\) resolve
REM correctly -- required because Task Scheduler starts in C:\Windows\System32
REM unless a working directory is set some other way.
cd /d "C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\montgomery-county-ohio"

REM Step 3: Make sure the logs folder exists
if not exist logs mkdir logs

echo Running the crawler script...
REM -u = unbuffered stdout/stderr, so log lines show up in the file in real
REM time instead of sitting in a buffer until the process exits.
python -u montgomery_scrape_cases.py >> logs\run_log.txt 2>&1
